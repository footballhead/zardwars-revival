<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry035">RIP</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Monday, August 31, 2015</div>
<p>It is with a heavy heart and reluctant hands that I inform you that ZardWars is dead. The site and servers cannot be accessed which makes playing the late game impossible.</p>
<p>I am lost for words so I leave you with some advice from the brilliant mind of Don Hertzfeldt, an obscure reference fitting for an obscure game:</p>
<p>Do not lose time on daily trivialities, do not dwell on pety detail, for all of these things melt away and drift apart within the obscure traffic of time. Live well and live broadly; you are alive and living now. Now is the envy of all of the dead.</p>

<div class="newsdate">Sunday, August 17, 2014</div>
<p>An eagle-eyed reader has been emailing me various typos and errors around the site which I've been working on fixing. Many thanks!</p>
<p>Changes include (updating as I go along):</p>
<p>
* Any occurrence of "armour" has been changed to "armor" in order to be more consistent with the game<br>
* The same goes for using "armors" as the plural of "armor"<br>
* The same goes for changing occurrences of "defence" to "defense"<br>
* "Golden Shield" has been corrected to "Golden"<br>
* "Earthern Plate" has been corrected to "Earthen Plate"<br>
* Fixed description for RainStorm<br>
* Fixed capitalization of element for Golden Axe on the weapons list page<br>
* We managed to scrape together some info for Golden even though I can't buy it yet<br>
* Fixed broken links on RSS<br>
* Removed speculation from Golden Plate page until it can be substantiated<br>
* Fixed description for Golden Axe, and added BTH<br>
* Added info for Pygmy Zombie Entourage pet<br>
* Added new monster: Narrviz<br>
* ...<br>
</p>
<p>Again, huge thanks to the reader who has been sending in all these!</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry033">While I'm At It...</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Sunday, September 8, 2013</div>
<p>Thought I should give all of you wonderful people an update on what I've done this past week:</p>
<p>
* Finally changed from using "Enemies" to "Monsters" because the latter is what's actually use<br>
* Finally made the HTML title use spaces and better capitalization instead of underscores and all lower case<br>
* Pretty much doubled the number of monster entries<br>
* Improved image quality for some monster entries<br>
* Added "Click to enlarge" caption text under thumbnails which are clickable; feature mainly used on spells but also on some monsters<br>
* (Backend) Wrangled monsters into a subfolder; they were getting unwieldy<br>
* (Backend) Subfolders are ignored when generating the HTML title
</p>
<p>I had a bit of help with some of the monster entries from some dedicated fan who has been offering their services! Thank you!</p>
<p>There's always stuff I could do to make things better. Like I could fix bulleting, which hasn't worked for a while. Or I could add some psuedo-mark-down feature for encyclopedia entries. Maybe I could fix up the forum. I could also try HTML 5.</p>
<p>A quick heads up: I might be moving to a new host and domain name. I'll try to keep you updated. I hope it doesn't become a hastle for anyone.</p>

<div class="newsdate">Monday, September 2, 2013</div>
<p>... for who knows how long.</p>
<p>I finally added a thing that makes the browser titles appear with proper capitalization and with spaces instead of underscores. You know, a thing I should have done years ago.</p>
<p>I'll try to do some more enemies before I inevitably vanish again. I may also get the forums back up. I may also have some help completing the enemies. Who knows. (Well, I have a vague idea.)</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry031">On the Subject of E-Mails</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Friday, August 17, 2012</div>
<p>First off, I would like to apologize to those individuals who e-mailed me while I was absent and who didn't get a response. I stated that I would reply to every e-mail I got and this wasn't the case. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Second, I'm still accepting e-mails. I would love for people to send me stats for things like the Golden Axe or Golden Shield, or even monsters I don't have.</p>
<p>Lastly, I received a question through e-mail that went unanswered. The sender asks "How do you take a picture of the shield without having the weapon block it?". When you attack with the Golden Plate the animation first drops the shield where you were standing then leaps at the opponent. If you get rid of your pet you can take an unobstructed screenshot of the shield. Crop it and voila! It works very well on the snowy background where Snow Bunnyzards are fought.</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry030">Done Spells</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Thursday, August 16, 2012</div>
<p>Done adding spells. Need to link to the guests with the summon spells yet. Enemies are next. Might write a guide from my experiences sometime.</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry029">Spells</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Wednesday, August 15, 2012</div>
<p>Revamp should be finished. Rewrote a lot of the pages, made encyclopedia articles more objective, and finished converting items over to XML.</p>
<p>I'm now adding spells. Despite what the index shows I've only done Daybreak, Fireball, Heal Wounds, and Salad Shooter. Clicking on the image thumbnail on a spell entry will enlarge the image.</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry028">The Revamp Continues</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Tuesday, August 14, 2012</div>
<p>I've removed all subjective information from the encyclopedia. The opinions belong in a guide, not on the encyclopedia articles. Also, if there was a stat that the game didn't specify or make completely obvious that was removed from the entries too.</p>
<p>I still haven't figured out a good way to deal with weapon special rates, weapon special damage, and the likes. I'm all open to suggestions.</p>

<div class="pagehead"><a name="entry027">Major Revamp</a></div>
<div class="newsdate">Monday, August 13, 2012</div>
<p>There is a major revamp in progress. Please be patient and hold on to your hats.</p>
