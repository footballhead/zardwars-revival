<div class="pagehead">What is ZardWars?</div>
<p>Zardwars is a flash game created by Artix Entertainment in 2005. The front page indicates that it was created as a "test [of] having multiple game databases". It is important to note that Zardwars can only be played by Adventure Quest Guardians, those who have paid for an upgraded account in the game Adventure Quest. Since launch the game has only been updates once, which occured during 2007.</p>
<p>The gameplay is functionally similar to that of Adventure Quest: your character and your opponent take turns battling until only one remains standing. Experience that you gain by beating opponents help your character level up, which provides more stat points, health, and mana. Gold found on the opponent's remains allow your character to buy improved gear to aid in battling more foes. Indivial opponents have their own unique traits: they are weak to some attacks while stronger against others and have their own combination of stats. Your character can choose between a variety of weapons, armor, shields, pets, and spells, which each have their own benefits. Battling is the only thing to do in this game.</p>
<p>Zardwars has been on a general decline since release. Our only hope is that this doesn't cause the game to vanish.</p>
