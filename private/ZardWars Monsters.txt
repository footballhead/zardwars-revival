RayZard - More intelligent than most zards, the RayZard is the preferred pack animal for the dwarven miners of Oreia because they do not easily get lost in the maze of the mine shafts.

Energyzard - Created by the Lord of Energy to power his massive weapon forges, some EnergyZards escaped their master's stronghold and now run rampant.

Mermazon Archer - An underwater race of astonishing agility, Mermazons serve the Lord of Water unquestioningly. Mermazon Archers harness the dangerous energy element to propel their arrows.

Quizzat - A bouncy creature with a desire to be left alone. It happens to be quite tasty thought, despite its apperance, and is a favourite target for hunters.

Ganzard - Straight from the world of StickQuest comes the fabled Ganzard. It's a tough opponent because stick monsters possess great durability when facing 3 dimensional enemies. Use the Stick Blade to beat the Ganzard off with a... stick?

Lesser Zombie - A zombie is not someone who died and was reanimated -- it is someone who is halfway between life and death. They survive by sucking life from the fully living. This one has gone a long time without sucking life energy and is weakened.

Fire Drakel Wizard - This lizard is an infernomancer. All shall burn at his feet. Which is scary! Have you ever seen Drakel feet?

WhaleZard - THe ZardMaster in his quest to blend zard DNA combined the Tadzard with the oceans most massive creature: the Battle Whale. Now with the WhaleZard roaming the depths adventurers should take care when they go swimming!

BlizZard - This diabolical creature of the Zardmaster, crafted for war, has an icy disposition, and is all spike, all ice, and not very nice! Normally bound to arctic lands, it follows its master's command, hunting the cold wastelands in search of prey, often young adventurers.

Zard Ice Pack - This is a small group of very icy zards. Do they travel in packs to keep warm? Or to keep safe? You could ask them, but don't get too close...

Zeel - Zeels are the ghastly result of the energy sorceress Kreehana's crossing of man with eel. Kreehana is still believed to be alive, and still up to her old tricks somewhere...

Toadzard - The ZardMaster created this creature with demonic horns and poison skin glands. Hikers are advised to use caution when travelling through Greengaurd Forest, as ToadZards have been known to eat humans whole!

InfernoZard - This mutant zard was devised in a hidden volcano by the diabolical ZardMaster. Its heat is so intense, that it can melt things with a small blast of flames.

Grizzle - Grizzles are an enchanted race of energy creatures that dwell in the forests. Because of their low-level animal intelligence, they often become scared and force battle upon unwitting travelers.

LightZard - The ZardMaster found some uncontrollable RayZards that were let go by dwarf miners. He bred them to be even more powerful and aggresive than before. Unlike the other breeds, they seem to actively seek out humans as their main food source!

Razorwing - Razorwings patrol the world of Lore, the eyes of the Wind Lord. Normally remaining high above, this razorwing must think you're an easy target...
