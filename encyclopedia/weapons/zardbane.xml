	<name>ZardBane</name>
	<description>A fairly powerful light weapon constructed by Zhilo. But when it encounters zard monsters it deals Element X damage, plus 3 base and 5 random. Re-equip it at start of each battle for Element X damage to work.</description>

	<OTHER>
		<Notes>This weapon has a few bugs. First, it doesn't trigger on Jeffrey because he doesn't have "zard" in his name. Second, you need to re-equip against zards to get the ElementX to work. Third, the trigger does not work with the Invisibility Cloak. Also note that ElementX has the same icon as Fire.</Notes>
